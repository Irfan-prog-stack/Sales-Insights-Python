# üß† Sales Insights using Python

### üìä Project Overview  
This project analyzes electronic sales data using **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** to uncover key business insights.  
It demonstrates how raw data can be cleaned, transformed, and visualized before being connected to a BI tool such as Power BI.

---

### üéØ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw sales data.
- Analyze sales performance by product, region, and month.
- Identify top-performing products and profit trends.
- Prepare a clean dataset ready for dashboard integration.

### üîç Process Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning (`data_cleaning.ipynb`):**  
   - Removed missing & duplicate records  
   - Fixed inconsistent column names  
   - Added new metric `TotalSale = Quantity √ó Price`

2. **Data Analysis (`sales_analysis.ipynb`):**  
   - Sales trend by month  
   - Profit vs discount relationship  
   - Top 5 products by total sale

3. **Visualization (`visualization_demo.ipynb`):**  
   - Created exploratory plots  
   - Exported results as `.png` for reporting  

4. **Exported for BI Tools:**  
   - Final cleaned dataset: `product_summary.csv`
